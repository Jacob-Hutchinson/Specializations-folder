        <h1>Welcome to the Movie and Food Generator</h1>
        <p>You can use this website to look for popular movie selections or find delicious food sugestions. I had a hard time Deciding between lots of movie options and being confident that it was a good one. thus Movie and Food Generator was born. I can now use this website to select one of the top 5000 movies in the United States of America or narrow down the selection by adding a genre and time frame. this is helpful if you are looking for a comedy from the 90's or a action from the 80's. This website has helped made selecting a movie much more effecient. I love it/use and hope you will to!</p>
